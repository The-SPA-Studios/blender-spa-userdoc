Some voices can be heard saying that Blender looks very complicated , but it is in fact a very streamlined and simple program even for 2D Animation. At least we are working at making it so. At SPA we are developing our own studio-specific Blender with a set of UI changes and tools to ease newcomers to it and continue refining its capabilities based on your direct production feedback. This document aims to give you the basic knowledge to quickly start Animating with the SPA version of Blender . Let's get started. Install and launch Blender SPA TODO: Write launch instructions for the outside world. Open SPA 2D Animation Template The first time you launch Blender you will be see the Blender Splash Screen. On the right is a list of recent files, on the left is templates to create a new file from. To get started in the SPA Animation experience select SPA 2D Animation template. After launching the template you will see the default SPA Animation workspace. This workspace is opened on a drawing canvas in Draw Mode, you can now begin drawing your first keyframe. Return to the Splash Screen You can always re-open the Splash Screen by using the Blender Logo > Splash Screen in the top right corner of your Blender window. This will re-open the Splash Screen which usually appears when you first launch Blender. Interface Basics Green: Toolbar This area contains tools like the Draw tool, Eraser tool and the Quick Edit tool. Yellow: Drawing Space This area is your canvas for drawing. Blue: Timeline/Dope Sheet The Dopesheet is where animation keyframes can be viewed/moved Red: Quick Access Panel The Quick Access panel is where you will find shortcuts for most Animation work Navigation Middle Mouse Action will in the future be set by default for artists launching Blender, temporarily please follow the below procedure to ensure you have the correct navigation settings. Set your Middle-Mouse Preference right! By default the Middle Mouse Button in Blender will Orbit around your object in 3D Space, which is not desirable for 2D artists. Before you start, Open Edit>Preferences find the Keymap section from the sidebar of the preferences window. And set Middle Mouse Action to Pan as the default (instead of Orbit). Basic Navigation of your Canvas To quickly navigate your scenes, Blender has some handy keyboard shortcuts. These come in the form of Zoom, Pan, and Rotate Canvas Shortcuts. Also do not forget to press the ESC key if you get lost or performed an operation you are not sure about and want to get out of. Or press the camera icon to get back to default view Pan: Move your Pen/Mouse Left and Right or Up and Down while Holding Down the Middle Mouse Button to pan the Canvas Zoom: Move your Pen/Mouse Up and Down while Holding Down CTRL + Middle Mouse Button to zoom in/out Rotate Canvas: Move your Pen/Mouse and Hold Down SHIFT + CTRL + Middle Mouse Button , Use CTRL + SHIFT + R or the Blue Rest Icon in the lower center of your screen to reset your Rotated Canvas Mirror Canvas: SHIFT+ W to mirror canvas at the current views center. SHIFT+W again to reset. Your first strokes To begin drawing in Blender simply start drawing in the Drawing Space/Canvas area. Use the Dope Sheet to navigate to a new frame and use I on your keyboard to insert a keyframe. Radius The Radius of a Brush can be controlled in the Header menu. The use pressure button allows for tablet pressure inputs on the Radius . You can quickly adjust the Radius with \u201cF\u201d on the Keyboard. Under the Tools>Brush Settings>Radius menu a custom curve can be set for the strength for more precise control. Strength The Strength is how Dark the stroke is, this can also be controlled by pen pressure. To set the Strength , edit it in the header menu, under the tools panel or use the keyboard shortcut SHIFT+F. Under the panel Tools>Brush Settings>Strength menu a custom curve can be set for the strength for more precise control. Changing Colors In the Quick Access Panel under the header Colors is a menu to select different colors for your drawing. Simply select one of the preset colors and continue drawing in the newly selected color! Erase a Stroke To remove a stroke with the Eraser tool, select the Eraser from the Toolbar on the left. You can now erase strokes, use the Strength to adjust how effective your Eraser is. Select the Stroke option to quickly erase entire strokes. Edit a Stroke To Edit a stroke, find the Quick Select tool on the left Toolbar area. Using the Quick Edit tool users can manipulate strokes. This transform box works similar to transform boxes in other 2D Animation software. To learn more see Quick Edit Tool doc. Enable SPA Theme Dopesheet now has an updated look over vanilla blender to make it easier to read. You must have the SPA Theme enabled to do this follow the Enable SPA Theme page . Navigate to Edit>Preferences Open the Theme tab Select the SPA theme from the Dropdown Navigating Between Drawings There are several ways to switch the active layer, it can be selected from the Drawing Box or the Dope Sheet area, as shown in Layer Management. To jump between layers and grease pencil objects in the viewport we have the shortcuts CTRL+SHIFT+CLICK and ALT+CLICK. From the Viewport Enabled Fade Inactive Objects + Grease Pencils from the overlays menu Enabled Fade Inactive Layers from the overlays menu Users can adjust the Fade opacity of inactive objects (set to .5 by default) Hover your Mouse/Pen over the stroke of an inactive drawing Ctrl+Shift and Click to make inactive drawing active Alt + Click to make an inactive layer in the current drawing active From the Dope Sheet Ensure you have Sync Selection enabled in the Dopesheet header. Select different layers in the Dopesheet the active object will update. Always show Active Drawing in Dope Sheet In Blender there is a a concept between active and selected. This means it is possible to have a drawing being edit-able but not appear in the Dopesheet. To avoid this issue enable the option Always Show Active under the Dopesheet header. Ensure you are in Draw Mode . From the Dopesheet header select the icon. Use the icon to enable Always show Active Object Further Reading Drawing Tools Brushes & Materials Layer Management Quick Edit Tool Select Layer from Viewport Rotating the Canvas in 2D Animation Tools Keyframing Drawings Current Keyframe Box Flipping Box Onion Skinning Box References Shift & Trace Box Import Image as Reference # Start Drawing The basic tools needed to start drawing in Blender. Brushes & Materials Pens or Brushes in Blender can be selected only when in Draw Mode . Pens will always define the shape or style of the stroke and can also sometimes define material or color of the stroke. The same pen can be used with multiple materials/colors. Pens can be selected from the top left menu. (only when in draw mode) Materials are defined in the Storyboarding Panel by Pallet Select a pallet under either Material or Vertex Color Vertex Colors can be defined manually, allowing for quick custom color changes and Palette definitions. Layer Management Each Grease Pencil Object contains its own set of layers. Layers in Blender work very similar to other 2D programs like Harmony. Layers can be ordered top to bottom to create a hagiarchy and easily hidden/locked. Hide Icon Lock Icon Onion Skinning Layer Opacity Add/Remove Active Layer Up/Down Active Layer Add New Drawing Objects To begin drawing in Blender you will need a Grease Pencil Object . Blender manages different sets of drawings inside of this Grease Pencil Object . It contains all data related to drawings including colors and layers. The Grease Pencil Object represents a 2D plane that drawings exist on. This object can be transformed and rotated in 3D space depending on the complexity of your scene. Select the \"plus\" icon to create a new drawing object A \u201cNew Drawing Object\u201d dialogue will open Name: Enter name based on convention TBD Location: This gives options to control where the object is in 3D space View Offset: Will place object in 3D relative to the camera\u2019s position 3D Cursor: Will place object in 3D at a fixed point via 3D Cursor View Offset: Set distance of object relative the camera\u2019s position The \u201cPin to Camera\u201d button See Pinning Drawings\u2026 Orient Axis: Restrict orientation to the select axis. The newly created object will appear in the object list Switching Between Drawings & Layers We can use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Click to jump between objects while selecting them directly in the Viewport or while selecting the object in the list of Objects in the Drawings Panel . This feature, in combination with the setting to Fade in Active Objects allows us to now clearly differentiate which object is active and which is inactive and to what level, and jump between them easily. Ensure you are in Draw Mode Ensure you have Sync Selection enabled in the dopesheet header. Enabled Fade Inactive Objects + Grease Pencils from the overlays menu Enabled Fade Inactive Layers from the overlays menu Users can adjust the Fade opacity of inactive objects (set to .5 by default) Hover your Mouse/Pen over the stroke of an inactive drawing Ctrl+Shift and Click to make inactive drawing active Alt + Click to make an inactive layer in the current drawing active Notice the Drawing Panel updates which drawing is updated Working with Palettes Importing Existing Palette Palettes are predefined groups of materials. SPA provides a couple of palettes by default and some of these are provided in the Animation and Layout template files. Create a new Palette Palettes are based on existing Grease Pencil Objects. Palette's are defined by materials with a prefix in their name. To create a new Palette we simply add a new material with a new prefix. Using a / to separate the palette from the material's name. The palette items are saved inside your Grease Pencil Object! For example: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MyPalette/Color</span> Open the Material's Tab with a Grease Pencil Active Use the + Button to Add a new Material Rename your material with palette title MyPalette as a prefix followed by / Name your new material now, and set its color Refresh your palettes to see your new palette in the side panel. Mirror the Viewport Mirroring the Viewport can be done either from the Storyboard side panel or a keyboard shortcut Move your viewport to the item to be mirrored From the Side Panel select the icon] Or use keyboard shortcut SHIFT+ W **Notice:** When viewport is mirrored, the butterfly icon will turn red: [![image-1664540679660.png](./images/gallery/2022-09/scaled-1680-/image-1664540679660.png)](./images/gallery/2022-09/image-1664540679660.png) and the top left will read **Camera Perspective** **(Mirrored)** if text info is enabled in the overlays menu. Enable SPA Theme SPA has a special theme to make it easier to read the Dopesheet. To enable the SPA theme follow these instructions. Navigate to Edit>Preferences Open the Theme tab Select the SPA theme from the Dropdown What's new in the SPA Theme Dopesheet now has an updated look over vanilla blender to make it easier to read. Active Object has a Light Blue Highlight on it's row Active Layer has a Light Green Highlight Inactive Object has a Dark Blue Highlight Inactive Layer has a Dark Green Highlight Edit Drawings How to edit your drawings, and navigate between different layers. Quick Edit Tool Similar to the selection tool in Harmony. The Quick Edit tool allows you to quickly select and transform any stroke within the Grease Pencil Object . It can be selected from the left Toolbar. Selection & Move Use the tool select and move a stroke in a Grease Pencil Object . Keyboard shortcuts allow for a more precise movement. The mouse cursor will display a hand icon when move is available. Use the Quick Edit tool to lasso a selection Click and Drag with Mouse/Pen on the transform box to move CTRL+ARROW KEY moves 1px CTRL+SHIFT+ARROW KEY moves 5px SHIFT+ Selection will add to the section CTRL + Selection will subtract from the selection Select blank canvas to deselect Select/Deselect All All strokes on the current frame can be selected and deselected with A or Alt+A Use \u2018A\u2019 while Quick Edit tool is enabled to select all strokes on the current frame Use \u2018ALT + A\u2019 while Quick Edit tool is enabled to deselect all strokes on the current frame Scaling Scale any selection either freely or while maintaining proportions. Scaling can also be done around the Pivot Point. Scaling is enabled when hovering over any point on the transform box. The mouse cursor will display a four way arrow when scaling is available. Select a drawing and select any point to Scale Hold SHIFT to Proportionally Scale Hold ALT to Scale around the opposite corner Hold SHIFT+ALT to Scale Proportionally around the opposite corner Rotate and adjust Pivot Point Rotate your selection from any corner. Adjust the pivot point for more advanced rotations. Rotation mode is available when the Mouse Cursor is in a + shape. Select Drawing and drag near any corner to rotate. Adjust pivot point to affect the rotation\u2019s origin. Skewing Skewing a drawing can be done from any side. Skewing mode is enabled when hovering along the length of the transform box. The mouse cursor will display a bidirectional arrow along the skew axis when available. Hover mouse/pen over transform box line Click and drag to skew Hold ALT to skew about the pivot point Copy & Paste Strokes can quickly be selected for copying to another frame or for duplication using the selection tool. Make a selection Use Ctrl + C to copy Use Ctrl + V to paste Duplication Make a selection Use SHIFT + D to duplicate Move the duplication with either the mouse or keyboard shortcuts Use X to move duplication horizontally Use Z to move duplication vertically Delete Strokes can quickly be deleted either an entire drawing or a portion of the drawing selected . Draw a selection Hit \"X\" to delete. Move Selection to Layer Strokes can quickly move to another layer using \u2018M\u2019 on your keyboard. Draw a selection Hit \"M\u201d to Move to Layer Select a destination layer Flip Strokes Draw a selection Use the Flip buttons in the Top Left header to mirror X/Y Mirror works on the current keyframe and can be animated across keyframes Select Layer from Viewport Select Layer from Viewport is a shortcut to quickly change the active layer while drawing. Select a layer by Alt clicking a stroke in your viewport. Ensure you have \u201c fade inactive layers\u201d enabled, this will visualize the change in active layer . ALT+LEFT CLICK over drawings to switch to that drawing\u2019s layer. The newly active layer will now be highlighted in the Drawings toolbox. Under Viewport Overlays ensure Fade Layers is enabled. ALT + LEFT CLICK over a stroke to make it\u2019s layer active Rotating the Canvas in 2D To rotate the current view use the Rotate Canvas shortcut. Can be used anywhere in the viewport. From either Camera or 3D View Keyboard Shortcut SHIFT+CTRL+MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON The Blue gizmo will help orient your rotation. At the button an reset icon will appear to show rotation is being used. Use the icon to reset the view. Or use shortcut SHIFT+CTRL+R Pegbars Pegbars are for offsetting, rotating and scaling individual Grease Pencil Layers. Pegbars are for only transforming layers inside 2D space. The peg bar system will always aligned with a Grease Pencil Object's drawing plane. Add Pegbar to Grease Pencil Object To create Pegbars select \u201cCreate Pegbar\u201d in the Side Panel A new Pegbar will be created at the center view Parent Peg to Layer To parent a peg to a layer select the layer in the Drawings Box Then under Peg: select the Peg that will be the parent of this layer Transform Pegs To transform a peg firstly ensure that the desired peg is active in the Pegbars Box From the Toolbar on the left select the BLANK icon under the Shift and Trace icon A green transform gizmo will appear, used to Scale and Rotate the peg Keyframe Peg Transforms Transform a peg to begin the keyframe process Use the button to insert new keyframes Keyframes will appear in the Dopesheet under Pegbar Mute Peg Action In the Pegbar menu find the desired peg Use the button to Mute/Unmute Peg Animation Hide Peg UI from Viewport In the Pegbar menu find the desired peg Use the button to Hide/Unhide Peg symbol in Viewport Add / Remove Pegs Pegs are always created at the object origin. Peg display location cannot be offset yet. Double Click any Peg\u2019s name in the Pegbars Menu to rename it Use the PLUS icon to add Pegs and the MINUS icon to remove Pegs Removing a peg will reset the associated layer back to it\u2019s original position Reset Peg Transformation To reset Transformation of a peg ensure the Peg is active in the Pegbars menu Select RESET Transformation in the Top Left of the Window. Parenting Pegs Create a new Peg name it \"Parent Peg\" Select the Layer Peg that will be it's Child and set the Parent: option to the Parent Peg. Transform the Parent Peg (remember use the keyframe button) The the Layer Peg is now the child of the Parent Peg and will inherit all transformations. Sculpt Mode Sculpt Mode in Blender is a way to manipulate strokes after they are already drawn. Sculpt mode can be used to tweak existing drawings, and clone/tweak similar strokes quickly. Sculpt Mode uses many brushes each with a unique characteristics like; Push, Pinch, Twist and more! Enter Sculpt Mode To Enter Sculpt Mode you must have a Grease Pencil Object active. From the top left of your viewport select Sculpt Mode. Navigate to VIEWPORT header find the Mode menu Select Sculpt Mode Hiding Edit Line Overlays In Blender each mode has an overlays menu. You can find the overlays menu by looking for the symbol. Navigate to Overlays Menu Disable Edit Lines Use the Vertex Opacity to fade the edit lines Using Sculpt Mode Sculpt Mode allows for manipulation of Drawing Strokes after they are drawn. Sculpt mode includes brushes to apply tweaks by painting over strokes. **TIP:** Hold down the CTRL key to invert any brush instead of selecting the +/- buttons from the header menu. Smooth Eliminates irregularities in the area of the drawing within the brush\u2019s influence by smoothing the positions of the points. Thickness Increase or decrease the points thickness in the area of the drawing within the brush\u2019s influence. Strength Increase or decrease the points transparency (alpha) in the area of the drawing within the brush\u2019s influence. Grab Grab selects a group of points on mouse-down, and pulls them to follow the mouse. The effect is similar to moving a group of points in Edit Mode with Proportional Editing enabled. Push Moves points in the direction of the brush stroke. Twist Twist the points in counter-clockwise (CCW) or Clockwise (CW) rotation. Pinch Pulls points towards the center of the brush. The inverse setting is Inflate, in which points are pushed away from the center of the brush. Clone Adds copies of the strokes in the clipboard in the center of the brush. You have to copy the selected strokes you want into the clipboard with Ctrl - C before using the tool. For More Info on Sculpt Mode see Blender Doc Animate Drawings Tools to control keyframes for animation and to organize keyframes for Flipping/Onion Skinning, Understanding the Dope Sheet Differences in Dope Sheet Views There are several different types of Dope Sheets that can be displayed in Blender. For the purposes of 2D Animation we want to focus on Dope Sheet, Action Editor & Grease Pencil. Action Editor: The action editor is limited to the current active object's animation data. It cannot show multiple objects, it cannot show Grease Pencil data. Grease Pencil: The Grease Pencil view only shows keyframes for grease pencil objects, can be multiple objects. It cannot show any Object animation data. Dope Sheet: The Dope Sheet can show all Object animation data, and grease pencil data, and from many objects not just the active one. Sync Layer Selection in the Dope Sheet Layer selection from the Drawing Box in the 3D Viewport can be synchronized with the current layer that is active in the Dope Sheet. Ensure you have Sync Selection enabled in the Dopesheet header. Select different layers in the Dopesheet the active object will update. Setting Filters in the Dope Sheet The Dope Sheet can be customized to show different views on different classes of objects. For example it can show everything but the Camera, or show hidden keyframes or not. To use Dope Sheet filters ensure you are in the Dope Sheet View. Summary: Is the header at the Top of the DopeSheet Only Show Selected: Will only Show the Selected Object Always Show Active: Will always Show the Active Object in Dopesheet Show Hidden : Will show objects or data that was hidden Only Show Errors: Show animation data that has lost it's object Filter by Type: Enable or Disable different types of objects in the Dope Sheet, (can be useful to only Show Grease Pencils Objects) Sort Data-Blocks : When disabled the order of the Timeline will match the Order of your Outliner Sync Visible Range When this setting is enabled, it will ensure that all regions share the same Zoom/Scroll levels. Please note that the Sync Visible Range setting must be enabled per timeline region. See below on where to find it. Open multiple Dope Sheet regions From each Dope Sheet's header select View>Sync Visible Range UI should now be synchronized across these Dopesheet Enable Channel Colors Blender allows users to organize channels using colors. To get started you must enable a setting in your user preferences. Go to Edit>Preferences Switch to the Animation tab Enable Channel Group Colors Under your drawings Object Data Properties tab Navigate to Layers>Display>Custom Channel Color Changes to this color will be reflected in the Dope Sheet for that layer Dope Sheet Overlays Dopesheet now has an updated look over vanilla blender to make it easier to read. You must have the SPA Theme enabled to do this follow the Enable SPA Theme page . Active Object has a Light Blue Highlight on it's row Active Layer has a Light Green Highlight Inactive Object has a Dark Blue Highlight Inactive Layer has a Dark Green Highlight Keyframing Drawings Keyframes are useful for controlling the timing. Keyframes can be placed automatically or manually. Using Keyframes in Draw Mode will allow for the creation of new frames. Using Keyframes in Object Mode will allow for the animation of objects including the camera. This can be used to for example animate a camera in a Master Layout which is often used in combination with Pinning Drawings to Camera . Manually Ensure at least one Grease Pencil Object is active. Use the Arrow Keys to navigate the Grease Pencil Dopesheet to the desired frame Use \u201cI\u201d on Keyboard or select Grease Pencil > Animation from the Header menu. ( Object>Animation to animate Camera/Objects) Automatically To enable Auto-Key select the Timeline region. Enable the Circular Auto Key button in the center of the Timeline region. New blank frames will be inserted automatically on the active layer. Current Keyframe Box Change Frame Type Keyframe types are used to filter drawings in operations like Onion Skinning and Flipping . Keyframe types includes : Normal keyframe (white / yellow diamond), Breakdown (small cyan diamond), Extreme (big pink diamond), and Jitter (tiny green diamond). Moving Hold (dark gray / orange diamond) To change the current keyframe type select a different keyframe type from the Current Keyframe box, status of any active frame will be displayed in this row. Navigate to the desired frame Check the desired layer is active Select a new Keyframe Type from the Current Keyframe box . Change Frame Duration To change the length of an active keyframe ensure there is at least one keyframe forward of the (otherwise the frame will be infinite, and its duration will be 0). Once between two keyframes the length of the active frame can be changed, and all other keyframes forward of the play-head on the active layer will shift. Navigate to the desired frame Ensure there is a keyframe forward of the play-head Adjust the duration by entering a number or selecting the handles to move one increment Flipping Box The Flipping menu allows you to rapidly flip through keyframes in the Grease Pencil Object . This allows you to quickly filter keyframe types to flip between. To change a Keyframe type for the purposes of filtering. Select the keyframe and hit \u201cR\u201d on the keyboard or from the Grease Pencil Dope Sheet header select Key>Keyframe Type. See Blender Manual for more information. Or use Current Keyframe box. To flip only on the active layer select the (left) single image symbol. To flip on all active layers select the (right) multi image symbol. Use the colorful keyframe symbols to filter which keyframe types to flip between frames. Click the filter icon to disable keyframe filtering Alternatively use Keyboard Shortcuts \",\" for flip left and \".\" for flip right. (comma=left and period=right) Enable the to loop the flipping sequence To consider preview range ensure the is enabled under Flipping. Choose Flipping Undo Behavior When using Undo by default Blender will include frame changes by default in the undo history. So Ctrl + Z will flip back to the last frame you saw. To disable this behavior enabled Stick To Frame under Flipping Undo Settings in the SPA Blender Addon Preferences. Onion Skinning Box Enable Onion Skinning to preview previous and next drawings. This can be filtered in various ways like by Frame, Keyframe, Selection and more. Use these filters to see only the frames you want. To enable Onion Skinning select the button. Adjust opacity of Onion Skins using the Opacity slider . Adjust the range of keyframes to be onion skinned with before/after. Keyframes Before/After can be filtered out using color/type (similar to Flipping) Mode to Display in Frames - Display every frame Keyframes - Display only keyframes Selected - Display only highlighted keyframes Tagged - TBD References and Review Tools to for importing references and tracing from drawings. Shift and Trace Box Shift and Trace is used to quickly move a drawing to another part of the screen for tracing in a non destructive way. Shift and Trace can be quickly enabled and disabled and is used primarily as a reference. Make sure the Shift & Trace Overlay is active from the Storyboard Panel . Select the Shift & Trace tool from the Toolbar on the left. Mode: Can be set to the Active Layer or any Editable Layer Use Current Frame allows you to shift the active frame. Custom Frame allows a specific frame to be targeted for shifting regardless of the playhead. The Shift & Trace tool uses move, scale, rotate and skew from the Quick Edit Tool . The tool is non-destructive, your edits will disappear when the overlay is disabled. To reset all edits or some edits use the Reset Menu in the Storyboard Panel Use CTRL+ARROW KEY to shift frames with the keyboard, similar to Quick Edit shortcuts Pinning Shifted Frames Pin your Shift & Trace to a selected frame using the new PIN icon. This means only the pinned frame will display Shift & Trace , so you can preview the rest of your animation easier. Import Image as Reference To import any image as a reference into Blender use the Import Image as Grease Pencil Reference option. This can be done using an image from your clipboard, or from a disk. This allows you to manipulate the reference image externally in any application and import into blender. Grease Pencil references are first class citizens that use all the same operations including transformations and keyframing. Import via Clipboard To import an image from clipboard take a screenshot using the built in Windows Screenshot tools , this will automatically copy the screenshot to your clipboard. You can also copy an image layer from photoshop or copy an image from the web. Take a screenshot Open Blender Ensure you are in Draw Mode Use CTRL+SHIFT+V to paste the image from clipboard into the active Grease Pencil layer. Your reference will now be available as a keyframe in the Dope Sheet. Import Image(s) from disk To import an image from disk. Open Blender Ensure you are in Draw Mode Use SHIFT+A to Open to Import References Browse for the Image(s) you want to import Enable Pack Image(s) to include the image in your .blend file Enable Create New Layer(s) to create a layer per image Layers will inherit Names from the Image file. Animating with 3D Objects Working with 3D in the Animation workspace. Moving Objects/Cameras Blender allows for multiple ways to control an object's position in 3D space. Blender Object can be moved multiple times and in combination with Keyframing can be used to animate Objects including the camera. Switch to Object Mode using the drawing toolbox. Select the desired object with your mouse From the left toolbar select the Move gizm o from the Toolbar . Rotate, Scale & Transform tools are also available from the same toolbar. Switching back to Draw Mode Draw Mode is where all drawing is done on the Grease Pencil Object as defined in the Creating a New Object section. Once in Draw Mode users can draw, erase, add/remove layers and add/remove keyframes and much more. An active Grease Pencil/Drawing Object is required to enter Draw Mode. Follow the Create New Drawing Object guide to add a new Object. Entering Draw Mode select an Object Select the enter Draw Mode button The interface will switch into drawing mode. To change the active drawing simply select a new drawing from the same list Pinning Drawings to Camera When the camera is animated in Blender it is important to manage the location of your Grease Pencil Object within the scene. Select an O bject from the Object list. Select the \u201c Pin to Camera \u201d button The Grease Pencil Object will now follow the camera\u2019s animation path. Selected and Active Objects Selection and Active are properties of objects only in Object Mode. To enter drawing mode on a certain object, it must be your active object, it is also possible to have a difference between an active and a selected object. There are many reasons why Blender separates these concepts. For example is Snapping locations from an Active Object to the Selected Object for more info on snapping see here . Another example Object Modes like Draw, Edit, Sculpt etc are dependent on your active object not your selected object. Single Active Object In the Outliner The single active object in this example is the Cube. Icon: Active Object will appear with a Faint Grey Background around it's icon in the outliner. (We know, yes. it's really faint!) In the 3D Viewport The single active object in these examples are first is the Cube, and second is the Camera. Origin Point: Single Active Object will have it's origin displayed as an Yellow Dot Single Active & Selected Object In the Outliner The single active & selected object in this example is the Cube. Icon: Active Object will appear with a Faint Grey Background around it's icon in the outliner. Name: The name of the Active Object will be H ighlighted in Yellow ** Item Row : The entire Item row in the Outliner is Highlighted in Blue In the 3D Viewport The single active & selected object in this example is the Cube. Origin Point: Single Active Object will have it's origin displayed as an Yellow Dot Outline: The Object's shape has a Yellow Outline Multiple Selected & Single Active Object In the Outliner The Active Object in this example is Cube. The selected Objects in this example are Camera, Light & Cube. Active Icon: Active Object will appear with a Faint Grey Background around it's icon in the outliner. Name: The name of the Active Object will be Highlighted in Yellow Item Row : The entire Item row in the Outliner is Highlighted in Blue Selected Name: The name of the Active Object will be Highlighted in Orange Item Row : The entire Item row in the Outliner is Highlighted in Dark Blue In the 3D Viewport The Active Object in this example is Cube. The selected Objects in this example are Camera, Light & Cube. Active Origin Point: Single Active Object will have it's origin displayed as an Yellow Dot Outline: The Object's shape has a Yellow Outline Selected Origin Point: Single Active Object will have it's origin displayed as an Orange Dot Outline: The Object's shape has a Orange Outline Clearing Selections If you have multiple selections made in Blender you can click anywhere in the 3D Viewport to clear the selection, or use the Alt-A shortcut shown below. Use shortcut Alt + A to clear selections. To learn more about Selection vs Active see the [Blender Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/outliner/selecting.html) Editing references Editing References With Blender, every artist as access to a full editing package.

This document aims to give you the basic knowledge to quickly start Layout in Blender at SPA . Open SPA Previz Template The first time you launch Blender you will be see the Blender Splash Screen. On the right is a list of recent files, on the left is templates to create a new file from. To get started in the SPA Animation experience select <strong>SPA Previz</strong> template. After launching the template you will see the default SPA Previz workspace. This workspace is opened to a 3D workspace you may be familiar with. Your first shot A shot is a container that points to a specific camera at a specific time in your blender scene. A sequence is composed of multiple shots, pointing to multiple cameras. Each camera can be used at different points in time, some cameras are reused multiple times. Shots are used to edit a sequence based on the action in your scene. Use Blender\u2019s Sequencer to add a new shot. To get started from the Sequencer header Menu find Shot > New . For more detail on how to add Shots see Understanding Shots Editing Toolbar The toolbar can be found by hitting T on your keyboard or navigating to View>Toolbar in the toolbar you can find the selection tool and the blade tool. Load Reference Video into Sequencer Move your sequence clips up to the second channel by using Y and moving your mouse upwards. Create a new Movie clip by going to Add>Movie You can select a channel in the loader settings on the Right side of the pop up Your reference is now in the sequence View your reference in the same area as your sequencer by enabling View>Preview as Background Switching a Shots Camera Each shot in the sequencer is linked to a scene and a camera. You can see a list of these shots and their corresponding data under the sequencer panel. This is a comprehensive list of all the shots in your edit, the highlighted shot being the active shot on the current frame. When a shot is highlighted its properties become available to modify; scene, camera and focal length. For example if you want to change the camera assigned to SH0010, navigate to the shot SH0010 in the sequencer. Find the Layout > Sequence side panel . Select a new camera from the Camera dropdown menu. Rendering your Sequence Rendering is the process of exporting the final frames of animation from the editing area into either Movie or Image files. This rendering workflow allows simple batch rendering of all or selected shots in the Sequencer . The render area allows for playback of the rendered images. Navigate to the Sequencer > Storyboarding Panel in Editing area Set the following settings under Batch Render Set media type: Images or Movie. This will define the output file type. Renderer: Viewport=Faster Internal=Standard Render Engine OutputScene: This output is usually RENDER or SEQ Render File Pattern: output to a folder called render at the location of the blend file Selection Only: only render highlighted clips from the sequencer. Select Sequencer Batch Render to begin rendering Once complete the user will see the completed files in the Render area tab Editing & Rendering Understanding shots A Previz sequence can be composed of a single \u201cshot\u201d or multiple \u201cshots\u201d. A shot is a container that points to a specific camera at a specific time in your blender scene. A sequence is composed of multiple shots, pointing to multiple cameras. Each camera can be used at different points in time, some cameras are reused multiple times. Shots are used to edit a sequence based on the action in your scene. Use Blender\u2019s Sequencer to add a new shot. To get started from the Sequencer header Menu find Shot > New . For more detail on how to add Shots see Managing Shots In most cases during Previz a Blend file will contain one Scene where all action occurs, any shots in the sequence will point to this same Existing Scene. In this case each shot or strip represents both a \u2018Camera\u2019 and \u2018a point in time\u2019 within an existing scene. Shots can also point to a different Blender Scene. Shots that point to different scenes is an advanced topic, covered later in the document. See Switch a Shot's Scene for more information Navigating Between Shots The 3D Viewport and Dope Sheet timeline interfaces can be synchronized with the master play-head from the Sequencer. When scrubbing from scene to scene in the sequencer, the corresponding scene content will be shown into the 3D Viewport and Dope Sheet. Pay attention to the difference in behavior between scrubbing or using arrow keys in each area (Dope Sheet or Sequencer) Using the Sequencer scrub or play to navigate between shots. 2. Using the Dope Sheet , navigating frame by frame with the arrow keys, the next shot will load after the final frame. (only frame by frame not scrubbing) 3. Using the Dope Sheet scrub the timeline to remain in that current camera\u2019s view. (only scrubbing not frame by frame) Switch a Shot\u2019s Camera Each shot in the sequencer is linked to a scene and a camera. You can see a list of these shots and their corresponding data under the sequencer panel. This is a comprehensive list of all the shots in your edit, the highlighted shot being the active shot on the current frame. When a shot is highlighted its properties become available to modify; scene, camera and focal length. For example if you want to change the camera assigned to SH0010, navigate to the shot SH0010 in the sequencer. Find the Layout > Sequence side panel . Select a new camera from the Camera dropdown menu. Switch a Shot\u2019s Scene In the Layout>Sequence panel there is a list of all Shots and their corresponding scenes/cameras described in Switching Shot's Camera . When a shot is highlighted it's scene can be edited. Navigate to the shot you want to change in the sequencer. Inside the Layout > Sequence side panel . Select a new scene from the Scene dropdown menu. See the Blender Manual for more information on scenes. Add, Remove and Manage Shots New Shots To add a shot select Shot New from the Sequencer Header Menu. Update the shot number, in most cases shots will be derived from the Existing scene. Shot Name Set a Prefix/Number/Take: Use to get the next available shot name Scene : Use existing ( most cases ) or create a new scene from a Template Source : Available scenes + templates: (more about 2D templates TBD) Duration - Set the duration in frames Channel - Select a row (aka channel) to place this new clip on, in the Sequencer Duplicate Shot When Duplicating a shot, the selected contents are appended to the end of your timeline, this also means that these clips are shifted in the Dope Sheet. To duplicate a shot without adjusting its timing in the Scene world use Shift + D. Delete Shot Each shot is associated with a scene. To delete a shot normally simply select Shot>Delete and leave Delete Scenes unchecked or hit \u2018 X \u2019 on the keyboard. To remove a shot and the associated scene use Shot>Delete and check the Delete Scenes option. Warning: ** Delete Scenes ** option will remove associated Scene data from the outliner. Adjust Shot\u2019s Timing Adjust timing will change the length of a strip in the sequencer and in the Dope Sheet. Adjust Timing affects only one clip at a time. To adjust timing of multiple shots at the same time see Roll an Edit Rename a Shot To rename a shot use Shot>Rename . This will work on a single shot at a time, use the to get the next available shot number. Check the rename scene to also rename the scene associated with this strip. Rename All Shots After editing your shot names may be out of order. To reset the numbering of all shots use Shot>Cleanup>Chronological Numbering . This will rename all shots based on the specified naming convention. Scenes can also be renamed by selecting a scene rename policy. Refining your Edit Using the Editing Workspace, refinements can be made to edit using Blender\u2019s Sequencer . The Editing area can be used to refine your edit and add effects/transitions as needed. Before you begin ensure you have the Editing Workspace selected from the header. Edit a Shot\u2018s Duration Dope Sheet : Select one of the frame handles at the bottom of the Grease Pencil timeline and drag. Sequencer : Select a frame handle with a mouse. Hit \u2018G\u2019 on the keyboard, move the mouse. Slipping a shot A slip edit means adjusting the in and out points of a clip simultaneously by the same amount in the same direction keeping the total duration of the clip the same. The clips start and end points within the Dope Sheet will change, but not on the sequencer. From the Dope Sheet select the handle on top of the clip and drag. Roll an edit A roll edit adjusts the start point and the endpoint of two adjacent clips simultaneously. Do this if you want to move an edit and also adjust the shot\u2019s timing in the Dope Sheet. Managing Shots New Shots To add a shot select Shot New from the Sequencer Header Menu. Update the shot number, in most cases shots will be derived from the Existing scene. Shot Name Set a Prefix/Number/Take: Use to get the next available shot name - Scene : Use existing ( most cases ) or create a new scene from a Template - Source : Available scenes + templates: (more about 2D templates TBD) - Duration - Set the duration in frames - Channel - Select a row (aka channel) to place this new clip on, in the Sequencer Duplicate Shot When Duplicating a shot, the selected contents are appended to the end of your timeline, this also means that these clips are shifted in the Dope Sheet. To duplicate a shot without adjusting its timing in the Scene world use Shift + D. Delete Shot Each shot is associated with a scene.

This will rename all shots based on the specified naming convention. Scenes can also be renamed by selecting a scene rename policy. Render your Previz Sequence Note When you publish your file, a sequencer render will be generated and uploaded to ShotGrid with all the proper burned in informations. **The pipeline recommended way of rendering is** **to do a publish** (TODO: link to publish section) Rendering is the process of exporting the final frames of animation from the editing area into either Movie or Image files. This rendering workflow allows simple batch rendering of all or selected shots in the Sequencer . The render area allows for playback of the rendered images. Navigate to the Sequencer > Storyboarding Panel in Editing area Set the following settings under Batch Render Set media type: Images or Movie. This will define the output file type. Renderer: Viewport=Faster Internal=Standard Render Engine OutputScene: This output is usually RENDER or SEQ Render File Pattern: output to a folder called render at the location of the blend file Selection Only: only render highlighted clips from the sequencer. Select Sequencer Batch Render to begin rendering Once complete the user will see the completed files in the Render area tab *** Ensure your viewport is in *[* rendered mode *](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/3dview/display/shading.html)* when performing a viewport render. *** Import and Conform Sequence from Editorial SPA Blender allows us to Import a sequence from editorial and automatically generate a sequence of storyboard panels from it. To begin you will need an AAF file from editorial. Open Blender and Navigate to the Sequencer Region From the Sequencer header select Editorial>Timeline I/O>Import Timeline to import an AAF into Sequencer Enter the AAF path into the file browser and confirm With your edit imported select Editorial>Conform>Generate Shots from Panel to create scene strips from the editorial sequence. Setting Frame Range for Render In sequence workflow, we have many different scenes inside a single blend file. To adjust the timing of your sequence's final render, the EDIT scene needs to have it's frame range adjusted. Because the Sequencer workflow uses the EDIT scene, we can set the frame range directly in the sequencer area. To Learn More about Render Range see Differences between Render Range and Preview Range Select all strips in your sequence Navigate to the Sequencer area's header Selected View>Range>Set Frame Range to Strips Setups, Scenes and Collections Understanding the Sequencer Workflow at SPA The sequencer workflow at SPA leverages Blender scenes to manage data. An EDIT scene is created for you and it will only contain the Scene Strips that make up the current edit. To use the sequencer workflow, your sequencer region's active scene (green area) must be set to this special EDIT scene. When correctly set, and Synchronization enabled, the rest of your Blender window will update contextually to the current strip's scene content (red areas) . It's magic! Current Scene: Current scene that is being viewed in the viewport. All regions highlighted in Red above reflect data from the current strip's scene. Master Scene: The Scene usually called \" EDIT \" that contains the strips that make up this files sequence. The edit region is highlighted in Green above. Output Scene : A blank scene usually called \"RENDER\" which contains the final exported clips. Override Sequencer Region Scene Ensure these settings are set to be in the correct sequencer setup. Sequencer Region : Set scene to EDIT Master Scene set to EDIT Creating new Blank Scene In some cases, when Blender files do not already contain a RENDER or EDIT scene users may need to manually create new scenes. Follow these steps to create a new Scene to use in the Sequencer Region. At the top of your Blender window selected the Duplicate Scene Button Copy Settings from current Scene Rename to desired name ( EDIT, RENDER) Moving the Sequencer will return you the the original scene (if sync is enabled) You must have more than one scene available in your blender file to add scene strips. If you cannot add Blender Scenes please follow **Create a New Blank Scene** guide to create an **EDIT** scene. Rendering to an Output Scene Output scenes will contain a rendered copy of your edit. Output scenes are used to review and finalize your edit. You can use your output scene to add transitions and effects to the rendered strips. Ensure Output Scene is set to a blank scene like Render Understanding Scenes & Collections Important Terminology Scene A Scene in the context of Blender is an environment that contains one or more collections. By default you are always working in at least one scene. Having more than one is a way to organise lots of collections. So if collections contain objects, we can think of our Scene as a kind of theatre stage where our objects can be placed. #scene-setups Strip A strip in the Video Sequence Editor works like a movie strip in any movie editor you are used to; like in iMovie. Instead of containing a video, Green Strips in Blender are \u2018Scene Strips\u2019 and represent different scenes at different times. This allows us to cycle through multiple stages or groups of objects from the sequence perspective. Collection A Collection is a container used for grouping elements in the outliner that we are using in the 3D viewport. Collections Scene Setups Are Scenes Setups used for creating new Collections inside a reused Setp containing specific elements we don't want to share from shot to shot. Identify \"Same as Camera\" Shots 3D Previz creates its master blender files based on sequences, environments and division of work among the artists. 2D Layout will create its master Blender files based on sequences, task assignments (Background or Character posing), division of work (shot assignment) and CAM position. Those CAM position will define the amount of 2D setups we will need to create for our sequences. A 2D setup is the scene based on the shooting camera. These can work for single shots (one offs) or various (masters & reuses). Although the Previz artists will try and utilize same as cameras/bg\u2019s as much as possible in the 3D phase, spotting opportunities for reusing material is an important tasks we need to address at 2D Layout. Not only it will be saving time for ourselves, but also later on during BG painting. We can spot those Same as CAMs in N Panel/ Layout/ ShotCams: Ex: PSH0140, PSH0160 & PSH0180 are sharing the same Shot CAM & Scene: 0140 being the master 0160 being a perfect reuse 0180 being a reuse containing a child of scene For shots sharing same as CAMs we should always try to reuse our 2D set ups. Ultimately if they don\u00b4t work we will be creating a new Scene Setup and redoing them, but we don't want to work the o ther way around. Note: Child Scene Setups can be created recursively many times, a new Child setup will always contain the current scene plus an additional collection not shared back to its parent. Master Scene, straight forward reuses & Child of Setups Master are Scene Setups containing Collections of GPOs working for Same as CAMs in different shots. The Master will be the original Scene towards which the reuses are pointing. We will be creating this Master the same as any other Setup and then this is how we create a straight forwards reuse. In the same ex: B0140 is the Master 2D Setup Scene for PSH0140 and is being used in PSH0160 as straight forward reuse, meaning every element in the scene is the same. This is how both PSH0140 & PSH0160 look in the outliner. Collections Before we continue on how we will be using Masters and reuses we need to understand Collections and how we use them. Collections are containers for keeping everything tidy inside our shots: is the way we group elements. In 2D Layout these group collections Shot Scene Collection We group and name these elements based on: task/shot Number/elements In the same ex: B0140 : \u201cB\u201d after BG tasks, it\u00b4s the Shot Scene Collection for P(Previz)SH(Shot)0140. In the following example. C0140 : \u201cC\u201d after CH posing task, it\u00b4s the Shot Scene Collection for P(Previz)SH(Shot)0140. Elements inside our Collections Grease Pencil Objects (GPOs) & cards like: BG : Layers of drawings Overlay (OL) 01 (being the closest OL to CAM) up to OL09 (for example, being the farthest to CAM). Character Collections : characters, animated or not. If there are. Props Collections : objects that have interaction with characters. If needed. FX Collections : Special effects. If needed. Others: reference material. If needed. Link to Naming Convention to learn more about this. Shared folders They can also be used as containers for element we want to share between shots. Since we are using Scene Collections as the main tool for this purpose, shared folders can carry other type of information (maybe reference material) so they can also be shared between shots that don't share Scenes. Consider that shared material, like objects in a shared folder, can only be oriented towards one single camera, and will appear not facing other Shot CAMs different than the one you\u00b4ve originally shared with. This is how we create them. To add an existing Shared Folder to a new Shot Navigate to the unlinked shot. Set the link icon to active The content of that Shared Folder should now be available in the outliner. Check Object's Usage in Sequence Objects can report which scenes they are being used by. To report an object's usage select that object in your viewport. Select Object Navigate to Properties>Object Properties>Sequencer Usage Select the Report Object use by Sequencer button A pop up will appear listing that object's usage. This information is also stored in the **Info** log. Open the **Info** region to read previous **Object Reports.** Grease Pencils Objects Understanding Grease Pencils Object and layer The GPO is both the container and the content of our drawings. The object itself is the container: the plane into space. The layers is the content: our drawings It's important that we understand this since now we are living in a 3D environment and we will be able to animate on both. Ex: a character moving towards CAM can be now animated Line & fill Layers work the same way as in PhotoShop (PS). You can create as many as you needed for your own workflow, but please remember when delivering try to stay as simple and organised as possible. Usually line & fill would be enough. Blender allows us to key also in specific layers. To draw on a layer ensure it\u2019s highlighted in the Drawings toolbox. Keep in mind that this can be useful for creating effects (light, glow\u2026). Materials At the beginning of each sequence we will need to create the materials we will be using. Materials will be basically the grayscale tint we will be using for our drawing: lines and fills. Pipeline team is working on creating default Material Libraries for different uses inside the production, including one specific for 2D LO. I recommend working with a list similar to this one: 100% black (line) for drawing, blue & red (line) for grids & 5 to 7 range of grayscale tones (fill) to fill the drawing. Unfortunately, for the moment we will have to create our owns when beginning a new sequence.Name it: Layout/whatever it needs to be (ex: Layout/30% fill ) and Blender will save it for your next shots. Creating Grease Pencils TODO: insert illustration here Our Scenes or 2D set ups are made of GPO\u00b4s: 2D drawings (planes) translating the 3D set up for specific CAM positions. While working on a shot every new GPO should be contained inside Collections. Start working on your shot (N Panel/Storyboard or Shift+A in Object Mode). A plane or card will be created in a specific location. It\u2019s your choice to first set the placement and then start drawing or the other way around (cursor to CAM, then Shift+F & drag). In draw Mode (N Panel/Storyboard) click Draw. Now you can start drawing. Moving Grease Pencils Grease Pencil objects as mentioned before are containers where all drawing information is stored. By entering Object Mode we can affect the transformation of our Grease Pencil Object in world space. Select Draw from the top of the Storyboard panel to exit Draw mode From the Toolbar on your Left, (open with Shortcut \u2018T\u2019) select a tool Move, Rotate and Scale tools are all available Your selected gizmo will appear at the \u201corigin\u201d of your drawing represented by a yellow dot Rescale Grease Pencil Proportionally Our 2D Set up\u2019s must work as a simplification of the 3D Set-up in terms of number of overlays and placement into space. This will affect mainly the parallax (if there is any) and the focus depth, and will help us gain consistency and cinematography. On one hand we need to make our shot work (in terms of parallax, if there is) and on the other we want to stay as simple as possible for the BG and Comp departments. The balance between those two needs will determine the number of OL\u2019s (GPOs) we should use. Create a new GPO. Draw the line based on the 3D Master on each one your GPO\u00b4s. Then fill it. Place them into its correct position in space: Select Cam, cursor to active using Shift + S Shift+F in order to scale (without changing the proportions from ShotCam POV.) Conventions and Details Sequencer Batch Render Why did my Batch Render Fail? Sequence Batch Render will take the current scene, and render each strip from your sequencer as a clip. Sequencer Batch Render will fail if GPU Shades are not compiled. When Sequence Batch Render is set to VIEWPORT mode, and EEVEE as the render engine, we must ensure that our viewport shading settings are set to Scene Lights + Scene World. Navigate to the Render Settings in Viewport Select Render/Material Preview Settings Enable Scene Lights / Scene World to compile shaders Sequence Batch Render will not fail when using '**Workbench'** Render Engine, regardless of shader compilation Why does my Batch Render look different? There is a difference in Blender between it's preview world and it's rendered world. Use one of the following setups to ensure you have a \"What you See is What you Get\" Experience, User need to align settings in Blender between the Viewport and the Renderer use one of the two following setups: Workbench: Set Material Shading mode to SOLID view Set Render Engine to WORKBENCH Eevee Set Material Shading mode to RENDERED view Set Render Engine to EEVEE Enable Scene Lights / Scene World Can I check my work before Rendering? Using the Sequencer + Preview option in Blender we can see a preview of what objects will be rendered by the Internal Renderer. Select Sequencer from the Sequencer Header Menu Select the option Sequencer + Preview Scrubbing the timeline will now show a Preview Window of your sequence Render in Solid mode. Differences between Render Range and Preview Range Frame Range In Blender the Range is the length of each Blender Scene's timeline. To set the Range, navigate to Scene Properties>Frame Range or in the Timeline area. Preview Range Preview Range is a temporary range on your scene, it is used to playback small sections of a blender file. The Sequencer workflow uses Preview Range to indicate the beginning and end of the current shot. A preview range is a signified with a symbol, and an orange overlay.
