# Get _Blender SPA_


## Windows (64 bits)

We provide a portable build of _Blender SPA_
with core changes and addons for Windows (64 bits).

Simply download it from the link below and unzip it,
and run Blender from there.

## Linux, MacOS and other platforms

While Blender and its addons are cross platform products,
we do not provide builds other than _Windows (64 bits)_.

To test _Blender SPA_ on a different platform you would have to
get and compile the [Blender fork][blender-spa] from its sources
and then manually install the [2D Animation][2d-anim-addon] and [Sequencer][sequencer-addon] addons.
