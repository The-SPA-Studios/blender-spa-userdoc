# _Blender SPA_ Documentation

## What is _Blender SPA_

_Blender SPA_ is the Blender fork and toolset used internally at [the SPA Studios](./about/studio).

It consists of:

- A fork of Blender containing some core changes
- A _Sequencer_ addon, improving the workflow for editing multiple shots at once.
- A _2D Animation_ addon, primarily intended to improve the Grease Pencil experience for traditional animators.

## What will I find in this documentation

This documentation is a guide for _Blender SPA_ users.

- The [layout guide](./layout) focuses on the improved sequencer workflow.
- The [animation guide](./anim) focuses on drawing and animation workflows.

Note that storyboarders and 2d layout artists might find useful information in both sections.

## Install


### Windows (64 bits)

We provide a portable build of _Blender SPA_
with core changes and addons for Windows (64 bits).

Simply download it from the link below and unzip it,
and run Blender from there.

[Download _Blender SPA v2.4.1_ for _Windows 64bits_][blender_spa-2.4.1-bundle-windows64.zip]

### Linux, MacOS and other platforms

While Blender and its addons are cross platform products,
we do not provide builds other than _Windows (64 bits)_.

To test _Blender SPA_ on a different platform you would have to
get and compile the [Blender fork][blender-spa] from its sources
and then manually install the [2D Animation][2d-anim-addon] and [Sequencer][sequencer-addon] addons.
