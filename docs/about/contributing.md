# Contributing

_Blender SPA_ is developed and used internally at [The SPA Studios](/about/studio).

It is shared as is, for the community to test, discuss, and hopefully draw inspiration for future Blender versions.
Note that the SPA Studios might not provide active support for any of the added features.

If you like it and want to contribute, we recommend you to [get directly involved in Blender development](https://www.blender.org/get-involved/),
and help promote our ideas to the _Blender Foundation_ and community.
